# Hand Gesture Recognition using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

This repository contains keras and implementations of the two deep learning models for hand gesture recognition presented in the article  [A Comparison of Bidirectional GRU and LSTM for Hand Gesture Recognition Using Leap Motion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10023591) here  by Muhammad Saad, Tianbao Yang, Hui Zhou.


## Getting Started

We will use American Sign Language (ASL) Dataset for training and testing of our model. We will train the following two bidirectional recurrent neural networkd models.
#### a) Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU)
#### b) Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)
